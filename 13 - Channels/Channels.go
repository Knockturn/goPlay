Channels can be used to pass data between different goroutines
in a safe way to avoid: race conditions, memory sharing problems.
AGENDA:
	- Channel basics
	- Restricing data flow
	- Buffered channels
	- Closing channels
	- For...range loops with channels
	- Select statements (like switch statement but built for channels)
