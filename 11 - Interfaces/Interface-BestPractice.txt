Best practices:

- Use many, small interfaces
    - Single method interfaces are some of the most powerful and flexible
        - io.Writer, io.Reader, interface{}

- Dont export interfaces for types that will be consumed
    - EX: DB example earlier
- Do export intercfaces for types that will be used by package
(above is backwards from what you do in C# - so this would not possible in C#)
- Design functions and methods to recieve interfaces whenever possible
